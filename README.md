# Conversations

This is a wiki about Conversations.  Or maybe it _is_ conversations.  One of those. :-)

Today, [[2021-09-01]], we're "doing wiki" on:

- [[Graph Visualizations]]
- a [[Torah View]] for wikis, and marginalia from medieval manuscripts
- [[Riamir]]'s [[Meta Maps]]
- [[Shared Language]]
- [[Mark Lombardi]] and [[Pete's search for Mark Lombardi which artually (lol) worked]]
- and [[embodiment]] or lack thereof in text and visualizations
- and [[Hypothesis]]
- and Pete's story of [Palo Alto, California: Birthplace of the Vacuum Tube](https://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/41232) (Lee de Forest), its connection to [[Socialtext]], its connection to the [[HP Garage]] (and thence to the birth of Silicon Valley, via Stanford)
- [[David Gurteen]], groups - "no reporting, just participate"
- "The Nine Billion Names of God", short story by [[Arthur C. Clarke]]
- [[Utopian Ruins]]

"People have a public life, a private life, and a secret life".

- (GABRIEL GARCÍA MÁRQUEZ famously told his biographer Gerald Martin: “Everyone has three lives: a public life, a private life, and a secret life.”)
